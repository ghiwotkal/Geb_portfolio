# Hi, I am Geb

I work as Research Assistant in the field of Applied Data Sciences and Statistics in the department of Mathematics in Khalifa University. I am interested in data analytics and data science. I have recently taken and completed the Google Data Analytics Certification Course on coursera. Some of the projects I have worked in are listed below.

## [Project 1: Google Data Analytics certificate Capstone - Case Study: How does a Bike-share Navigate Speedy Success?](https://github.com/ghiwotkal/Capstone_project/blob/main/Case%20study%20Cyclistic%20Bike-share%20Analysis.ipynb)
The marketing department in Cyclistic, a fictional company, wants to design a new marketing strategy to maximize the Cyclistic company’s profit and want to know how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently for a speedy success.
### Activities performed in this case study:
* Clearly defined the statement of the business task
* Prepared and described all data 
* Cleaned and processed historical bycicle trip data 
* Analyzed historical bycicle data in order to identify trends, understand how casual riders behave differently from riders with paid memberships using visualizations
* Proposed recommendations to  executives to make decisions about marketing programs and strategies to convert casual riders to riders with annual memberships to increase profit.

## [Project 2: Plink_PCA for Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/ghiwotkal/plinkPCA/blob/main/R%20Notebook.pdf)
* Plink principal component analysis (plinkPCA), a dimensionality reduction method, was applied to the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP-CEPH) data to understand the population structure. 
* HGDP data was originally  in a text format and was converted to .ped format and then the .ped formats to .bed, .bim and .fam
* Then plink command line codes were used to produce egenvalues and eigenvectors of the HGDP data.
* plinkPCA was applied to the HGDP data to visualize and understand the population stucture.

## [Project 3: covid19 wastewater projectrReport generator script](https://github.com/ghiwotkal/covid19_wastewater/blob/main/wastewater_covid19_detection_report.Rmd)
In here, a small R script that can take an excel sheet or csv file as input and generate a report with  [this format](https://github.com/ghiwotkal/covid19_wastewater/blob/main/wastewater_covid19_detection_report.pdf) was written.
